Dear Editors,

Please find enclosed a paper entitled "A Polylog Sequence Encoding for
Collaborative Editing" . This paper is a major extension of the
paper:

[1] obtained the best student paper award in
DocEng'2013.

Compared to previous works[1,2]:

* We prove the upper bounds on space and time complexities of
  LSeq. This result opens the way for building decentralized and
  scalable real-time editors.

* We ran extensive experiments characterizing LSeq's behavior. In
  particular, it outperforms state-of-the-art CRDTs for sequences.

* We describe all the outlines to develop a distributed collaborative
  editor for massive editing of large documents.  Following these
  guidelines, we built a real-time scalable and decentralized editor
  running in web browsers available at https://github.com/Chat-Wane/CRATE.
  In the Grid'5000 testbed, we launched editing sessions involving up
  till 600 connected browsers. It validates the scalability of editors built
  on top of LSeq.

Best regards,
