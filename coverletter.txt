Please find enclosed a paper entitled "A Polylog Sequence Encoding for
Collaborative Editing" we submit to the IEEE International Journal on
Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems. Note that there are three
parts in this paper among which the first two already appeared in the
conference ACM DocEng'2013 and the associated international Workshop
DChanges'2013. The paper that appeared in DocEng'2013 obtained the best student
paper award.

The first part presents the core of the contribution: a scalable replicated
data structure for collaborative editing. The second part presents the
concurrency effect over the overall performance of the proposed data
structure. Finally the new part proposes a proof of the sub-linear
(polylogarithmic) space complexity of the proposed data structure with respect
to the number of existing elements in this structure. In comparison, the other
solutions are linear. Also, instead of simulations, the experiments were
emulations running on the Grid'5000 testbed.
