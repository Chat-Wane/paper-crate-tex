Google Docs made real-time editing in browsers easy for millions of
users. However, Google mediates real-time editing sessions with central servers
raising issues on privacy, censorship, economic intelligence. It also raises
scalability issues in term of number of participants.  Despite that small groups
currently constitute the main range of users, larger groups (e.g. from massive
online courses, conferences, TV-shows) require support to share their notes too.
For instance, writing documents on Google Docs is possible uptill fifty
users. Next users have their rights limited to document reading.

Decentralized real-time editors~\cite{oster2006data, sun1998operational,
  sun2009contextbased} do not require intermediate servers and by the same solve
privacy issues. However, scalability issues remain.  Addressing these issues
requires finding a good trade-off between communication, space and time
complexities. Among others, it consists in a sublinear communication complexity
compared to the editing session size. While the transmission of operations
requires at least a multiplicative factor logarithmically scaling compared to
the network size, maintaining consistency requires piggybacking additional
metadata the complexity of which must be carefully studied.

Decentralized algorithms of operational
transformation~\cite{sun2009contextbased} require piggybacking a state vector in
order to detect concurrent operations. Unfortunately, state vectors grow
linearly compared to the number of participants that ever participated in the
authoring.

Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types~\cite{shapiro2011comprehensive} (CRDTs) such
as WOOT~\cite{oster2006data} piggyback a constant-size identifier which is
optimal. Nonetheless, their local space complexity grows monotonically which
eventually leads to the need of costly garbage collecting. Other
algorithms~\cite{preguica2009commutative, weiss2010logootundo} limit their local
space consumption. Nevertheless, they piggyback variable-size identifiers that
can grow linearly compared to the document size. In such case, they eventually
need to run a costly consensus algorithm to balance
documents~\cite{zawirski2011asynchronous}. Finally, Algorithm
\LSEQ~\cite{nedelec2013concurrency} aims to avoid such consensus by sublinearly
upper-bounding the space complexity of its identifiers. It conjectured a
polylogarithmic growth of the identifiers size $\mathcal{O}(\log(d)^2)$ where
$d$ is the document size.

In this paper, we propose \CRATE, a scalable real-time editor that runs on a
network of browsers. \CRATE relies on WebRTC and browser-to-browser
communication to provide an easy access for end-users. Compared to
state-of-the-art, it presents a new original trade-off which balances the load
between space, time, and communication complexities. The contributions of this
paper are threefold:
\begin{itemize}
\item Compared to previous work~\cite{nedelec2013lseq}, we demonstrate the upper
  bounds on space and time complexities of \LSEQ. It constitutes an original
  trade-off for building decentralized real-time editors.
\item Compared to previous work~\cite{nedelec2015spray}, we deployed the
  adaptive membership protocol \SPRAY in web browsers thanks to
  WebRTC. \TODO{Our observations on performance confirm the simulation results
    on setups involving real-time editing in browsers.}
\item We conducted experimental studies to validate the complexities of
  \CRATE. The experiments took place in the Grid'5000 testbed and involved
  uptill $600$ real web browsers opened to edit a shared document. At a rate of
  100 insertions per seconds, the document size reached above 1 million
  characters. As expected, we observed a logarithmic growth of the traffic
  compared to the number of participants, and a polylogarithmic growth of the
  traffic compared to the size of the document. This result confirms that \CRATE
  does not require any costly garbage collection mechanism.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork} reviews the related work with an emphasis on the
complexity trade-off proposed by other approaches. Section~\ref{sec:proposal}
follows with a description of \CRATE and its core
components. Section~\ref{sec:experiments} highlights the scalability of \CRATE
while validating the complexity analysis of \LSEQ and \SPRAY. Finally,
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and discusses about
perspectives.
