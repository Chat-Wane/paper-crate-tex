\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

Sequence replicated data structures (\emph{sequence} for short) are the closest
structures that can implement a shared document. 

\begin{definition}[Document]
  A document is a series of $k$ characters
  $d(H) = \alpha_1.\alpha_2\ldots \alpha_k$ produced by a series of operations
  $H$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Replicated sequence]
  Let $d(H)$ the document produced by the series of operations $H$. A replicated
  sequence of $d(H)$ is a structure $r(H)$ with a projection $\pi$ such that
  $\pi(r(H)) \rightarrow d(H)$.
\end{definition}

We focus on replicated sequences~\cite{shapiro2011comprehensive,
  shapiro2011conflict} that provide two commutative operations:
\textsc{insert} and \textsc{delete}. Operations can be integrated in
any order as long as the deletion of an element follows its
insertion. Assuming that the replicas integrated the same set of
operations, they converge to an identical state, i.e., users see the
same document~\cite{shapiro2011conflict}.

\noindent Each element of the sequence is associated to a unique and immutable
identifier. Using a dense total order on identifiers, we project the set of
pairs $\langle identifier,\, element \rangle$ to a sequence of elements. Since
elements are not explicitly assigned to an offset, a function \textsc{lookup}
retrieves the identifier at a targeted position in the sequence, and converse.

Each time a user types a character, the \textsc{insert} operation generates an
identifier for the new element.  For instance, let us consider a sequence
\texttt{QWTY} with the unique, immutable, and totally ordered integer
identifiers $1$, $2$, $4$, and $8$ respectively. A collaborator inserts
\texttt{E} between \texttt{W} and \texttt{T}. The natural identifier that comes
to mind is $3$. The resulting sequence is \texttt{QWETY}. However, \texttt{R}
cannot be inserted between \texttt{E} and \texttt{T}, for the identifiers $3$
and $4$ are contiguous. The space of identifiers must be enlarged to handle the
new insertion. If we consider identifiers as decimal numbers, we can associate
$3.1$ to the character \texttt{R}. Since $3 < 3.1 < 4$, the sequence of
characters is, as expected, \texttt{QWERTY}. Inserting a new character between
\texttt{E} and \texttt{R} would result in another space extension : $3.0.X$,
where $X$ is an integer.

% If a new character has to be inserted between \texttt{E} and
% \texttt{R}, a new identifier will be allocated between $3$ and $3.1$. Again, the
% space will be extended resulting in a new identifier $3.0$ suffixed by any non
% null integer. Let $X$ be this suffix, the order of the elements of the sequence
% is preserved since $(3 < 3.0.X < 3.1)$.

%% (TODO) are the paths of variable-size identifiers ?
Such growing identifiers are called variable-size identifiers. The main
objective is to keep the growth of the size of the identifiers under a sublinear
boundary.

\paragraph{Encoding a position in the sequence}
%\subsection{Encoding a position in the sequence}
%\label{subsec:variable}
Each \textsc{insert} operation generates an identifier that encodes the position
of the new character in the sequence using a dense order. Concatenations of
comparable elements constitute a mean to represent such dense order.
% can be represented as a concatenation of basic elements (e.g. integers).
The union of these identifiers creates a tree. Its nodes store the elements of
the sequence and its edges are labeled such that a path from the root to a node
containing an element represents the main part of the latter's identifier. For
instance, the character \texttt{R} in the previous example is accessible
following the path composed of the edges labeled $3$ then $1$.  This represents
the \emph{path} of an identifier.


% More formally, a sequence is a tree where each node contains a value i.e. an
% element of the sequence (over an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$). The tree is a set of
% pairs $\langle\mathcal{P}\subset\{\mathbb{N}\}^*,\, \mathcal{A} \rangle$, i.e.,
% each element is associated with a path. Additionally, a total order
% ($\mathcal{P}$,$<_{\mathcal{P}}$) provides an ordering among the paths which
% allows to retrieve the order of the elements in the sequence. Notation: a path
% composed of $e$ edges labeled $\ell_1,\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_e$ will be noted
% $[\ell_1.\ell_2\ldots\ell_e]$.

\begin{definition}[Path]
  A path is a series of integers noted $[\ell_1.\ell_2\ldots \ell_e]$ chosen in a
  set $\mathcal{P}$ paired with a dense order $(\mathcal{P},\, <_\mathcal{P})$.
  Each integer $\ell_i$ composing the path is chosen in a set
  $\mathbb{N}_{<X_i}$. The binary representation of a path of size $e$ requires
  $\textstyle \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^e \lceil \log_2 X_i\rceil$ bits.
\end{definition}

\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:treemodelexample} shows the underlying 10-ary tree representing
a sequence. Like in the previous scenario, the initial sequence is \texttt{QWTY}
with the respective paths $[1]$, $[2]$, $[4]$ and $[8]$. The insertion of the
character \texttt{E} between the pairs $\langle [2],\, \texttt{W}\rangle$ and
$\langle [4],\, \texttt{T}\rangle$ results in the following pair:
$\langle [3],\, \texttt{E} \rangle$. Then, inserting \texttt{R} between
\texttt{E} and \texttt{T} forces to start a new level, for there is no room at
the first level of the tree for any paths between these bounds. In this example,
the resulting path is $[3.1]$. Using the total order of paths, we retrieve the
sequence \texttt{QWERTY}.

% in case there is an insertion between the elements \texttt{E} and \texttt{R}.
% Assuming a 10-ary tree, the new path would be $[3.0.X]$ where $0<X<10$.


\paragraph{Disambiguation of concurrent cases}
%\subsection{Disambiguation of concurrent cases}
%\label{subsec:disambiguation}
The order among paths $(\mathcal{P},\,<_\mathcal{P})$ is a total order when a
single collaborator edits. However, it becomes a partial order when the editing
session involves several collaborators and concurrent operations exist. For
instance, two collaborators inserting a character at a same position in the
sequence at a same time may end up with the same allocated path. In such case
the order of characters is not strictly defined and may break the convergence
property. We need a disambiguator in each identifier to preserve their
uniqueness. This guarantees a total order among identifiers, hence convergent
replicas.

\begin{definition}[Disambiguator]
  A disambiguator is a globally unique marker chosen in a set $\mathcal{D}$
  paired with a total order $(\mathcal{D},\, <_\mathcal{D})$. Disambiguators
  usually comprise unique site identifiers along with Lamport
  clocks~\cite{lamport1978time}.
\end{definition}

Figure~\ref{fig:disexample} depicts a tree containing 6 elements with only 5
distinct paths. First, the collaborator $u_1$ inserts \texttt{QW}.  Then, the
collaborators $u_1$ and $u_2$ concurrently insert \texttt{E} and \texttt{T}
respectively. This happens to generate an identical path: [$3$]. To solve any
ambiguity about the order of characters, each identifier includes a
disambiguator.  Let a disambiguator be a series of pairs of unique site
identifiers and counters:
$[\langle s_1,\, c_1 \rangle.\langle s_2,\, c_2 \rangle \ldots \langle s_e,\,
c_e \rangle]$
where $e$ is the size of the path.  The disambiguator
$[\langle u_1,\, 6\rangle]$ is associated with \texttt{E}; the disambiguator
$[\langle u_2,\, 1\rangle]$ is associated with \texttt{T}. The disambiguator of
the character \texttt{R} inserted between \texttt{E} and \texttt{T} is
$[\langle u_1,\, 6\rangle.\langle u_1,\, 7\rangle]$.

\paragraph{Allocating variable-size identifiers}
%\subsection{Allocating variable-size identifiers}

Unique and immutable identifiers comprise both a path and a disambiguator in
order to preserve a dense total order, even in presence of concurrent
operations.

\begin{definition}[Variable-size identifier]
  A variable-size identifier is a triple $\langle p,\, \alpha,\, d \rangle$
  chosen in $\mathcal{I}$ where $p$ is a path chosen in $\mathcal{P}$, $\alpha$
  is an element chosen in an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, and $d$ is a disambiguator
  chosen in $\mathcal{D}$. The set $\mathcal{I}$ is paired with a dense total
  order $(\mathcal{I},\,<_\mathcal{I})$.
\end{definition}

In Figure~\ref{fig:disexample}, the dense total order is also lexicographic: at
each level we compare the paths, then the site identifiers, then the
counters. It is defined as :
\begin{align*}
  t_i < t_j \iff & (p_i < p_j) \vee  %\\
                  ((p_i = p_j) \wedge (s_i<s_j)) \vee %\\
                  ((p_i = p_j) \wedge (s_i = s_j) \wedge (c_i < c_j)) \\
  t_i = t_j \iff & \neg (t_i < t_j) \wedge \neg (t_j < t_i) \\
  id_i <_\mathcal{I} id_j \iff & \exists (m > 0)(\forall n < m),\, (t^i_n = t^j_n) \wedge                             (t^i_m < t^j_m) %\\
 % id_i =_\mathcal{I} id_j \iff & \forall m,\, t^i_m = t^j_m
\end{align*}
% Retrieving the order of elements simply consists in comparing 
In this example, the paths order most of characters. Nevertheless, \texttt{E}
precedes \texttt{T} because $p^\texttt{E}_1=p^\texttt{T}_1$ and
$s^\texttt{E}_1 < s^\texttt{T}_1$. Then, $u_1$ inserts \texttt{Y} at the end of
the sequence. Finally, $u_1$ inserts \texttt{R} between \texttt{E} and
\texttt{T}. Since \texttt{E} and \texttt{T} have an identical path, there is not
enough room for new insertions at this level. The allocation function chooses a
path $[3.X]$ where $0<X<10$. By copying the disambiguator of \texttt{E} at the
first level, it ensures that the new identifier will follow \texttt{E} and
precede \texttt{T}.

% Collaborators cannot influence the final position of the character in the
% sequence using disambiguators, for disambiguators are automatically computed
% without concerns about positions. The sequence of the example could have ended
% in \texttt{QWTREY} and it would have needed a correction.
%It is worth noting that 

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \input{input/crdtabstractalgo.tex}
  \caption{\label{algo:crdtabstract}General outlines of a sequence with
    variable-size identifiers.}
\end{algorithm}


Algorithm~\ref{algo:crdtabstract} shows the general outlines of these
sequences. It divides the operations into the local and remote parts of the
optimistic replication scheme. When a user types (resp. removes) a character,
the editor immediately executes the local part of the \textsc{insert}
(resp. \textsc{delete}) operation. The editor executes the remote part of
operations as soon as it receives it and that its precondition is checked.

\noindent Algorithm~\ref{algo:crdtabstract}'s core lies in the local part of the
insertion where it generates a path and a disambiguator. Firstly, to simplify
readability in the rest of this paper, \textsc{convert2Path} immediately gets
rid of the disambiguator contained in each identifier to keep paths only.
% Without evidence of concurrency, it simply returns the paths contained in
%the identifiers.
% Otherwise, 
It translates the identifiers into the closest paths that maintain their order
using only the order among paths, i.e.,
$(\mathcal{I},\, <_\mathcal{I}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{P},\, <_{\mathcal{P}})$.
For instance, considering the identifiers of Figure~\ref{fig:disexample}
$id_\texttt{R} = \langle [3.1],\, \texttt{R}, \, [\langle u_1,\,6
\rangle.\langle u_1,\,7 \rangle] \rangle$
and
$id_\texttt{T} = \langle [3],\, \texttt{T}, \, [\langle u_2,\,1 \rangle]
\rangle$,
comparing these identifiers results in
$id_\texttt{R}<_\mathcal{I} id_\texttt{T}$; but using only paths results in
$id_\texttt{T} <_\mathcal{P} id_\texttt{R}$. Implicitly, $id_\texttt{T}$ is the
path [$4$], for its first triple $t_1^{\texttt{T}}$ is greater than the
$id_\texttt{R}$'s one; and any path allocated between [$3.1$] and [$4$] builds
an identifier between $id_\texttt{R}$ and $id_\texttt{T}$.


% in Figure~\ref{fig:disexample}, the result of \textsc{convert2Path} with the
% identifiers of the character \texttt{E} and the character \texttt{T} is the pair
% $\langle [3.0],\, [3.9]\rangle$. 

\noindent Secondly, \textsc{allocPath} allocates a new path between these
bounds. It should choose among the paths with the smallest size for performance
sake. For instance, between [$3.1$] and [$4$], the available paths are [$3.2$],
[$3.3$], \ldots, [$3.9$]. \textsc{allocPath} chooses among these.


\noindent Thirdly, \textsc{allocDis} generates the disambiguator to associate
with the path in order to guarantee that the new identifier consistently fall
between the adjacent identifiers that served its allocation following the dense
total order among identifiers. For instance, considering that \textsc{allocPath}
chose the path [$3.2$], \textsc{allocDis} copies the $id_\texttt{R}$'s first
pair of the disambiguator $\langle u_1,\,6 \rangle$ to which it concatenates its
own unique marker: $\langle u_3,\,1 \rangle$. The resulting identifier is
$id_e = \langle [3.2],\, e, \, [\langle u_1,\,6 \rangle .\langle u_3,\, 1\rangle ]
\rangle$.
As expected, we obtain
$id_\texttt{R} <_\mathcal{I} id_{e} <_\mathcal{I} id_\texttt{T}$.
% The space complexity of disambiguators is upper-bounded by their respective
% path. Therefore, we focus on paths in the rest of the paper.

\noindent Finally, the editor broadcasts $id_{e}$ to all editors. Minimizing the
size of $id_e$ is important, for it directly impacts the generated traffic.

\paragraph{Choosing the smallest path}
%\subsection{Choosing the smallest path}
%\label{subsec:choosing}

The most critical part of sequences with variable-size identifiers consists in
creating the paths. The function that allocates identifiers must provide the
smallest possible paths without impairing future allocations. As shown in
Algorithm~\ref{algo:crdtabstract} at Lines~\ref{line:broadcastinsert}
and~\ref{line:broadcastdelete}, each identifier is broadcast to all editors. As
consequence, their size directly impacts the communication complexity of the
editor.

% The function \textsc{allocPath} chooses a path in the tree between two other paths
% $p$ and $q$ where $p$ precedes $q$: $p<_{\mathcal{P}}q$. The new path $n$ must
% fall between $p$ and $q$: $p<_\mathcal{P}n<_\mathcal{P}q$.
% However, the number of paths between two paths is infinite, for the order is
% dense, and so is the number of \textsc{allocPath} strategies. Nevertheless,

% This observation reduces considerably the number of possible allocation
% strategies.

    branch in the tree. All paths of the optimal case have a length of 1 while
    the tree of the worst case grows up to a depth of 6.}
\end{figure*}

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:allocpathexample}, the allocation of paths
without an \emph{a priori} knowledge of the final sequence is a non-trivial
problem.  Suppose that \textsc{allocPath} allocates the leftmost branch
available at the lowest depth possible. Suppose two insertion orders resulting
in an identical sequence of characters \texttt{QWERTY}.  In the first case,
\texttt{Q} is inserted first at position 0, followed by \texttt{W} at position 1
(after \texttt{Q}) then \texttt{E} is inserted at position 3 (after \texttt{W}),
etc.  In the second case, \texttt{Y} is inserted first at position 0 as the
sequence is initially empty. Then \texttt{T} is inserted. However as the final
intended word is \texttt{QWERTY}, \texttt{T} has to be inserted at a position
before \texttt{Y} that represents the current state of the sequence. \texttt{T}
is thus inserted at position 0 shifting \texttt{Y} to position 1, etc.


\begin{itemize}
\item Figure~\ref{fig:allocpathexampleA}: In this case, the insertion order
  exactly follows the expectations of the allocation function. The depth of the
  tree never grows. The execution of operations remain efficient.

\item Figure~\ref{fig:allocpathexampleB}: In this case, the insertion order goes
  against the expectations of the allocation function. The depth of the tree
  increase at each insertion. Indeed, as an element gets the smallest value at
  its level, there is no room for a new element at the same level, hence the
  creation of a new level. The depth of the tree grows very fast decreasing the
  efficiency of operations.
\end{itemize}

This example shows how the insertion order impacts the length of the allocated
paths. Unfortunately, the insertion order cannot be predicted nor the size of
the final sequence. Prior work on sequences often made the assumption of a
left-to-right editing due to observations made on
corpora~\cite{preguica2009commutative, weiss2009logoot}. However, there exist
human edited documents that do not correspond to this kind of
editing~\cite{nedelec2013lseq}. The problem is the following:
%% Indeed, the editing depends on the type of the document and to the activity
%% for example when correcting a document the editing in mainly random as the
%% insertions and deletions corresponds to errors distributed in the document.
\begin{problem}[Size of allocated identifiers]
  Let $s(I)= id_1.id_2\ldots id_I$ be a sequence of identifiers, and
  $s(I+1) = s(I) \cup \textsc{insert}(p,\, \_,\, n)$, with $p,q \in s(I)$ and
  $p<_\mathcal{I}q$. Let $|s(I)|$ be the size of the binary representation of
  the sequence. The function \textsc{insert} must allocate identifiers such
  that: \hspace{30pt} $|s(I+1)| - |s(I)| < \mathcal{O}(I)$ %% ugly spacing
\end{problem}

\noindent Large scale collaborative editors need of an allocation function that
provides identifiers with a sublinear space complexity compared to the number of
insertions whatever is the editing sequence that produced the document. Such
allocation function would avoid the need for consensus
algorithm~\cite{mostefaoui2015signature} and would make CRDT-based editors a
practicable alternative to the current mainstream editors.
