\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

Sequence data structures considered in this paper (for collaborative editing)
belong to the optimistic class of replication~\cite{saito2005optimistic}. Each
replica owner (a collaborator) directly performs operations on its local copy
and informs the other owners by broadcasting these operations. The consistency
criteria ensured by such optimistic replication is called strong eventual
consistency~\cite{shapiro2011comprehensive} upon the assumption of the eventual
delivery of operations, i.e., they guarantee that all replicas will eventually
converge to an identical state when the system becomes quiescent. This
consistency criterion is weaker than sequential consistency and linearisability
and is not comparable with causal consistency, yet strong enough for
collaborative edition~\cite{shapiro2011comprehensive}.

Sequence replicated data structures (\emph{sequence} for short) are the closest
structures that can implement a shared document. A sequence provides two
commutative operations: insert and delete. Operations can be integrated in any
order as soon as the deletion of an element follows its insertion.

The sequence is composed of elements and a unique and immutable identifier is
associated with each of these elements. The sequence can be seen as a set of
pairs $\langle element, identifier \rangle$. A total order is assumed on
identifiers and this order relation allows seeing the set of pairs as a
sequence. The projection of a sequence on the elements builds the document.

When a collaborator performs an insert operation, it first allocates the
identifier of the element to insert. For instance, let us consider a sequence
QWTY with the unique, immutable, and totally ordered integer identifiers $1$,
$2$, $4$, $8$ respectively. A collaborator inserts the element E between W
and T. The natural identifier that comes to mind is $3$. The resulting
sequence is QWETY. However, R cannot be inserted between E and T since
$3$ and $4$ are contiguous. The space of identifiers must be enlarged to handle
the new insertion. If we consider identifiers as decimal numbers, $3.1$ can be
associated with the character R. If a new character has to be inserted
between E and R, a new identifier will be allocated between $3$ and
$3.1$. Again, the space will be extended resulting in a new identifier $3.0$
suffixed by any non null integer. Let $X$ be the suffix, the order is preserved
since $(3 < 3.0.X < 3.1)$.

Such growing identifiers are called variable-size identifiers. The main
objective is to keep the growth of the size of the identifiers under acceptable
boundaries.

\subsection{Variable-size Identifiers}
\label{subsec:variable}

Variable-size identifiers can be represented as a concatenation of basic
elements (e.g. integers). The resulting sequence can be represented by a tree
structure where the elements of the sequence are stored at the nodes and where
the edges of the tree are labelled such that a path from the root to a node
represents the identifier of the element stored at this node. For instance, the
character $R$ in the previous example is accessible following the path composed
of the edges labelled $3$ then $1$. More formally, a sequence is a tree where
each node contains a value i.e. an element of the sequence (over an alphabet
$\mathcal{A}$). The tree is a set of pairs
$\langle\mathcal{P}\subset\{\mathbb{N}\}^*,\, \mathcal{A} \rangle$, i.e., each
element has a path. Additionally, a total order
($\mathcal{P}$,$<_{\mathcal{P}}$) provides an ordering among the paths which
allows to retrieve the order of the elements in the sequence. Notation: a path
composed of $e$ edges labelled $\ell_1,\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_e$ will be noted
$[\ell_1.\ell_2\ldots\ell_e]$.

  \caption{Examples of 10-ary trees containing the sequence of characters
    'QWERTY'.}
\end{figure*}


Figure~\ref{fig:treemodelexample} shows the underlying 10-ary tree representing
a sequences. Like in the previous scenario, the initial sequence is QWTY with
the respective paths $[1]$, $[2]$, $[4]$ and $[8]$. The insertion of the
character E between the pairs $\langle [2],\, \text{W}\rangle$ and
$\langle [4],\, \text{T}\rangle$ results in the following pair:
$\langle [3],\, \text{E} \rangle$. Then the insertion of Character R needs to
start a new level since there is no room at the first level of the tree for a
new path between E and T. The resulting path may be $[3.1]$ if label one is
chosen for the element R at the second level. This would increase the depth of
the tree in case there is an insertion between the elements E and R. The new
path would be $[3.0.X]$ where $0<X<10$ (recall that we assume a 10-ary
tree). The total order $(\mathcal{P},\,<_\mathcal{P})$ allows retrieving the
sequence QWERTY.

\subsection{Disambiguation of concurrent cases}
\label{subsec:disambiguation}

Two collaborators concurrently performing an operation on their respective
replica may get different results after the integration of both
operations. Indeed, $(\mathcal{P},\,<_\mathcal{P})$ is a total order when a
single collaborator edits. However, it becomes a partial order when the editing
involves several collaborators. Consequently, it is necessary to totally order
the elements inserted by different collaborators. To this end, the
disambiguation function $\delta$ associates a disambiguator to each pair of
$\mathcal{T}$. $\delta: \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}\times\mathcal{A}$.
There exists a total order ($\mathcal{D}$, $<_{\mathcal{D}}$) such that elements
of the sequence are always comparable pairwise, even if they have an identical
path due to concurrency. 

Let the identifiers $\mathcal{I}$ be the set of unique triples
$\mathcal{I}:\mathcal{P}\times \mathcal{A}\times \mathcal{D}$. The composition
of the partial order ($\mathcal{P}$, $<_{\mathcal{P}}$) and the total order
($\mathcal{D}$, $<_{\mathcal{D}}$) allows ordering the elements of the sequence
identically at any replica.

Figure~\ref{fig:desexample} depicts a tree containing 6 elements with only 5
distinct paths (two values are associated with the path $[3]$). Similarly to the
previous example, the initial sequence was QWTY, however, in this example, the
two elements E and R are inserted between the pairs
$\langle [2],\, \text{W}\rangle$ and $\langle [4],\, \text{T}\rangle$ by two
different collaborators concurrently. For both elements, the resulting path is
$[3]$. After the two elements are inserted, the sequence becomes either QWERTY
or QWRETY. Nevertheless, let the identifiers
$\langle [3],\, \text{R},\, \delta_\text{R}\rangle$ and
$\langle [3],\, \text{T},\, \delta_\text{T} \rangle$. Assuming that
$\delta_\text{R} <_\mathcal{D} \delta_\text{T}$, the total order
$(\mathcal{I}, <_\mathcal{I})$ gives the sequence QWERTY. It is worth noting
that disambiguators are usually computed using a monotonically increasing
variable and a unique collaborator identifier just like Lamport
timestamps~\cite{lamport1978time}. Therefore, a collaborator cannot directly
influence the final position of the character in the sequence using
disambiguators. The sequence of the example could have ended in QWRETY and it
would have needed a correction. Also, the space complexity of disambiguators is
bounded by their associated path. Therefore, we focus on paths in the rest of
the paper.

\subsection{Choosing the rightful path}
\label{subsec:choosing}

The most critical part of sequences with variable-size identifiers consists in
creating the paths. Algorithm~\ref{algo:crdtabstract} shows the general outlines
of these sequences. It divides the operations (insert and delete) into to
different parts, the local and the remote phases of the optimistic replication
paradigm. As we can see, most of the core of the algorithm and the associated
complexity represents the local part of the \textsc{insert} operation where the
algorithm has to generate a path (cf. Line~\ref{line:allocpath}) and a
disambiguator (cf. Line~\ref{line:allocdes}).

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \input{input/crdtabstractalgo.tex}
  \caption{\label{algo:crdtabstract}General outlines of a sequence with
    variable-size identifiers.}
\end{algorithm}

Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the set of unique triples
$\mathcal{I}: \mathcal{P}\times\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{D}$. The set of the
elements of a sequence is a subset of $\mathcal{I}$. For any element $i$ of a
sequence ($i \in \mathcal{I}$), let $i.P$, $i.A$, $i.D$ be the respective
accessors to the path, the element, and the disambiguator of element $i$. The
function $allocPath$ chooses a path in the tree between two other paths $p.P$
and $q.P$ where $p<_{\mathcal{T}}q$. This means that element $i$ has to be
inserted between two elements $p$ and $q$ such that $p$ precedes $q$ in the
sequence. However, since it is always create new levels in the tree and thus
new sub-trees, the number of possible paths is infinite, and so is the number
of $allocPath$ functions. Nevertheless, the function $allocPath$ should choose
among the all the possible paths the one having the smallest length in order to
have smaller identifiers keeping good performance. This observation reduces
considerably the number of possible $allocPath$ functions. Still, the
allocation of paths without an \emph{a priori} knowledge of the final sequence
is a non-trivial problem.

  \caption{\label{fig:allocpathexample} Two trees filled with the resulting
    identifiers of two different permutations resulting in an identical
    sequence $QWERTY$. They use the same function $allocPath$ which allocates
    the leftmost branch in the tree. All paths of the nearly optimal case have
    a length of 1 while the tree of the worst case grows up to a depth of 6.}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:allocpathexample} illustrates the difficulties of designing a
function to allocate the paths. It represents the underlying trees of two
sequences using the allocation function: they allocate the leftmost branch
available at the lowest depth possible. In both cases the final sequence is
$QWERTY$, however, the letters are not inserted in the same order. In the first
case, $Q$ is inserted first at position 0 (initially the sequence is empty),
followed by $W$ at position 1 (after $Q$) then $E$ is inserted at position 3
(after $W$), etc. We call the sequence of insert operations $[(Q,\,0)$,
$(W,\,1)$, $(E,\,2)$, $\ldots]$ the \emph{editing sequence}. In the second
case, the letter $Y$ is inserted first at position 0 as the sequence is
initially empty. Then $T$ is inserted. However as the final intended word is
$QWERTY$, $T$ has to be inserted at a position before $Y$ that represents the
current state of the sequence. $T$ is thus inserted at position 0 shifting $Y$
to position $1$, etc. The editing sequence that corresponds to this case
is thus $[(Y,\,0)$, $(T,\,0)$, $(R,\,0)$, $\ldots]$.


\begin{itemize}
\item Case 1: Since the function $allocPath$ allocates the leftmost branches,
  the following editing sequence $[(Q,\,0)$, $(W,\,1)$, $(E,\,2)$, $\ldots]$
  leads to the paths $\langle [1],\, Q\rangle$, $\langle [2],\, W\rangle$,
  $\langle [3],\, E\rangle$, etc. In this case, the depth of the tree never
  grows. In this regard, this function $allocPath$ is very efficient in terms
  of the size of the allocated identifiers.

\item Case 2: The editing sequence $[(Y,\,0)$, $(T,\,0)$, $(R,\,0)$, $\ldots]$
  leads to an increase of the depth of the tree at each element
  insertion. Indeed, as an element gets the smallest value at its level
  (cf. the allocation function), there is no way to insert a new element before
  at the same level hence the new level. The resulting sequence is
  $\langle [1],\, Y\rangle$, $\langle [0.1],\, T\rangle$,
  $\langle [0.0.1],\, R \rangle$, etc. Consequently, the size of the paths
  grows very fast.
\end{itemize}

This example shows how the insertion order impacts the length of the allocated
paths. Unfortunately, the insertion order cannot be predicted, nor the size of
the final sequence. Prior work on sequences often made the assumption of a
left-to-right editing due to observations made on
corpus~\cite{preguica2009commutative, weiss2009logoot}. However, there exist
human edited documents that do not correspond to this kind of
editing~\cite{nedelec2013lseq}. Indeed, the editing depends on the type of the
document and to the activity for example when correcting a document the editing
in mainly random as the insertions/deletions may correspond to
errors. Consequently, we are looking for an allocation function which provides
identifiers with a sub-linear spatial complexity compared to the number of
insertions whatever is the editing sequence.
