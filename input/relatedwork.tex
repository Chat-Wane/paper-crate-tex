\item[Optimistic replication] is a replication strategy where each peer owns a
  local copy (or replica) of the document. Since users can directly modify this
  copy, it improves both availability and responsiveness. When a user performs
  an operation on the local document, the information is spread to all owners of
  the shared document where they are integrated. Optimistic replication
  approaches guarantee eventual consistency~\cite{bailis2013eventual}. Hence,
  after the receipt and integration of all operations by the members, the
  replicas converge to an identical state.
\item[Centralized] collaborative editors constitute an easy way to ensure
  documents eventually consistent. There exist a plethora of these
  (\TODO{examples}).  Nevertheless, the topology itself lack of scalablity and
  suffer of issues in privacy, censorship, single-point-of-failure, ease of
  deployment, economic intelligence, and restriction in terms of service.
\item[Decentralized] collaborative editors are rare in comparison. With such
  topology, the algorithms and data structures are rethought to handle the
  operations arriving disorderly.  To insert a character in a shared document,
  one cannot just use the standard well-known operation \emph{insert element at
    index} of arrays and expect guaranties on convergence. For instance, if two
  users concurrently edit a sequence ERTY: the first user inserts a Q at index
  0, while the second user inserts a W at index 0. They respectively obtains
  QERTY and WERTY as resulting sequence. On receipt of each other's operation
  they respectively obtain WQERTY and QWERTY. Hence the need to inspect these
  concurrent cases to ensure convergent replicas.  Many approaches have been
  proposed with the challenging task to find a good compromise between
  complexities in time, space, and communication.
\item [Operational transformation] constitute the former approaches aiming to
  solve the concurrent cases. Their principle lies in modifying the arguments of
  the received operation against its concurrent ones. For instance, in the prior
  example, when the first user receives \emph{insert W at 0}, it detects
  \emph{insert Q at 0} as concurrent, and decides to transform the operation
  into \emph{insert W at 1}.  In that spirit, a wide variety of OT approaches
  exist for text editing, image editing etc. In text editing context, OT can
  provide the usual insertion and deletion operations plus a range of
  string-wise operations such as move, cut-paste, etc. However, operational
  transform approaches have drawbacks. \TODO{First, the quadratic time complexity of
  the transformations compared to the number of concurrent operations which
  precludes its usage on the Internet subject to unpredictable latency and, in
  particular, the existence of an offline editing mode. Second, the structure to
  detect concurrency is expansive, i.e., it requires the history of all
  operations and a causality tracking mechanism}. \TODO{moar}.
\item [Conflict-free replicated data types] for sequences constitute the latter
  approaches which solve the concurrent cases by providing commutative and
  idempotent operations. Thus, the receipt order of operations does not impact
  the final resulting document. These approaches provide commutativity by
  associating a unique and immutable identifier to each element. Defining a
  total order among the identifiers allows retrieving the sequence. There exist
  two class of CRDTs for sequences:
  \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item [Tombstone CRDTs] whose removals of elements only hide the latter to the
    users. 
  \item [Variable-size CRDTs] whose identifiers are allocated with different
    size at generation.
  \end{inparaenum}
\item [As summary], Table~\ref{table:complexities} shows the complexities in
  space, time, and communication of decentralized approaches. \TODO{moar}
