Real-time distributed collaborative editors consider multiple participants, each
hosting a copy -- or replica -- of a shared sequence of characters. The
participants can update their copy by inserting or deleting characters at any
time. Then, the editor eventually delivers the change to all
participants. Finally, each editor integrates the received
operations~\cite{saito2005optimistic}.

\noindent According to~\cite{sun1998achieving}, collaborative editing requires
to ensure the CCI properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Convergence: replicas integrating a same set of operations converge to an
  equivalent state~\cite{bailis2013eventual, shapiro2011conflict}, i.e., users
  see an identical document;
\item Causality: if an operation precedes~\cite{lamport1978time} another
  operation, the integration of the former always precedes the integration of
  the later;
\item Intention preservation: effects observed at generation time must be
  re-observed at integration time regardless of concurrent operations. 
\end{itemize}



% To ensure that participants read
% identical documents, strong eventual consistency~\cite{bailis2013eventual,
%   shapiro2011comprehensive, sun1998achieving} states that a system is correct if
% and only if editors integrating a same set of operations converge to an
% equivalent state. Furthermore, operations must preserve the intention of users,
% i.e. effects observed at generation time must be re-observed at integration time
% regardless of concurrent operations. Finally, the integration order of
% operations must follow the \emph{happen before}
% relationship~\cite{lamport1978time} stated at generation.

\noindent Four complexities characterize collaborative editors:
\begin{itemize}
\item Generation time: complexity to generate locally an operation.
\item Integration time: complexity to execute remotely an operation.
\item Space complexity: complexity to store a local copy of the shared sequence.
\item Communication complexity: complexity of messages transiting the network.
\end{itemize}
Solving scalability issues requires finding a balance between communication,
space and time complexities %  Among others, the communication complexity is the
% most discriminant and depends of metadata required to ensure strong eventual
% consistency as well as messages dissemination in the network.
where the communication complexity plays the most important role. The challenge
consists in providing a sublinear upper bound on communication complexity
without making other complexities impracticable.

% It requires $\mathcal{O}(m.\ln{R})$ where ($\ln{R}$) is a minimal multiplicative
% factor induced by the broadcasting mechanism which depends of the session size
% $R$ including both readers and writers; where $m$ is the message embedding
% metadata necessary to maintain consistency. To scale, the space complexity of
% these metadata must be sublinear.


Operational transformation (OT) constitutes the core of both centralized and
decentralized real-time editors. OT ensures the CCI
properties~\cite{sun1998achieving}. At generation, the processing time of
operations is constant. At integration, OT transforms the received operations
according to concurrent ones which were generated on the same state. An
integration algorithm such as COT~\cite{sun2009contextbased} or
SOCT2~\cite{vidot2000copies} along with transformation functions (ensuring
transformation properties) guarantee a consistent model. The integration time
depends on concurrency and differs among the algorithms.  For instance, COT's
integration time complexity is exponential. It can be reduced to linear at the
expense of space complexity. SOCT2's integration time complexity is quadratic in
terms of number of concurrent operations.  Regardless of the tradeoff, OT's
integration algorithms rely on concurrency detection which costs, at least, a
state vector~\cite{charronbost1991concerning} the size of which grows linearly
compared to the number of members $W$ who ever participated in the
authoring. Since each message carries such a vector, decentralized OT approaches
are not practicable in large and dynamic groups where people frequently join and
leave the editing session.
% As for space complexity, OT approaches require an historic of operations $H$,
% each operation being linked to their state vector, hence
% $\mathcal{O}(W.H)$. Such monotonically growing historic can be cut at the
% price of consensus which, once again, does not
% scale~\cite{mostefaoui2015signature}. Thus, OT approaches are the best in
% humble confined environment like local area networks. However, their
% performance degrades when the network size grows and becomes unpredictable
% like wide area networks.

Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for
sequences~\cite{shapiro2011comprehensive, shapiro2011conflict} constitute the
latter approaches which solve concurrent cases by providing commutative,
associative, and idempotent operations. 
% Cci
The causality property of CCI that
precludes editors to reach large scale can be relaxed. Contrarily to OT, CRDTs
only require to track semantically related operations. For instance, the removal
of a particular element must follow its insertion. 

%ccI
Intentions for sequence are defined with the help of a dense
order~\cite{weiss2010logootundo}.
%
%\begin{definition}[Intention of operations of sequences]
  A sequence is a set of elements paired with a dense order, i.e., elements are
  ordered and inserting between two elements is always possible.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Inserting the element $e$ at position $i$ in the sequence becomes
    inserting the element $e$ between the element at position $i-1$ and the
    element at position $i$;
  \item Deletion an element at position $i$ in the sequence removes the element
    from the set without impairing the order of other elements.
  \end{itemize}
%\end{definition}

CRDTs implements this dense order by associating a unique and
immutable identifier to each element of the sequence. 

%cCi
Convergence property is obtained by making insert and delete
operations commutative.

% To guarantee the properties of convergence and intention preservation, they
% defines a dense total order among identifiers. Using this order retrieves the
% sequence of characters.

\noindent CRDTs propose an interesting tradeoff, for they can balance
complexities depending on the type of structure that represents the document.
In particular, increasing the generation time of operations to decrease the
integration time is profitable since an operation generated once is re-executed
many times. Nevertheless, identifiers consume space and impact the communication
complexity.

% WOOT, WOOT, WOOTH, RGA, SW, PPS, DiCE
Tombstone-based CRDTs~\cite{ahmed2011evaluating, conway2014language,
  grishchenko2010deep, oster2006data, roh2011replicated, weiss2007wooki,
  wu2010partial, yu2012stringwise} such as WOOT~\cite{oster2006data} associate a
constant size identifier $\mathcal{O}(1)$ to each element but removals of
elements only hide them to users. Therefore, removed elements keep consuming
space leading to a monotonically growing replica, hence $\Theta(I)$ where $I$ is
the number of insertions performed on the document.  Destroying removed elements
requires running consensus algorithms to determine if everyone received the
removal and agrees on definitely throw out the element. Such algorithms are
prohibitively costly and do not scale in terms of number of members, especially
in networks subject to churn~\cite{mostefaoui2015signature}.
% Since the structure contains the full history of the document, such approaches
% do not require further information to track causally related operations.

Variable-size identifiers CRDTs~\cite{nedelec2013lseq, preguica2009commutative,
  weiss2009logoot} such as Logoot~\cite{weiss2009logoot} truly destroy elements
targeted by removals.  Since removals truly erase information from the
structure, these approaches require a local state vector compacting their
history, hence an additional $\mathcal{O}(W)$ on space complexity. It is worth
noting that, contrarily to OT, the vector stays local. Variable-size identifiers
approaches allocate identifiers the size of which is determined at
generation. The allocation function becomes crucial to maintain identifiers
under acceptable bounds. Unfortunately, they depend on the insert position of
elements. For instance, writing the sequence \texttt{QWERTY} left-to-right
allocates the identifiers [1] to \texttt{Q}, [2] to \texttt{W}, [3] to
\texttt{E}, \ldots, [6] to \texttt{Y}. But with an identical strategy, writing
the same sequence right-to-left allocates the identifiers [1] to \texttt{Y},
[1.1] to \texttt{T}, [1.1.1] to \texttt{R}, \ldots We observe a quick growth of
identifiers depending on the editing behavior. In both cases, the growth is
linear compared to the number of insertions $I$ in the sequence,
i.e. $\mathcal{O}(I)$. Both Treedoc~\cite{preguica2009commutative} and
Logoot~\cite{weiss2009logoot, weiss2010logootundo} suffer from the growth of
identifiers which negatively impacts the generated traffic.
% If the structure stores each identifier in a flat array, it grants fast
% access
% at the price of quadratic space complexity $\mathcal{O}(I^2)$. If it
% factorizes common parts of identifiers as a tree structure, it achieves a
% linear space complexity.
To provide small identifiers, these approaches eventually require balancing the
structure, i.e., relocating identifiers. This requires a global agreement which is
akin to run a distributed consensus
protocol~\cite{zawirski2011asynchronous}. Unfortunately, these protocols do not
scale.

\noindent The algorithm \LSEQ~\cite{nedelec2013lseq} aims to avoid such
consensus by sublinearly upper bounding the space complexity of variable-size
identifiers. \cite{nedelec2013lseq} conjectured a polylogarithmic progression of
its identifiers size $\mathcal{O}((\log I)^2)$ compared to the number of
insertions in the document. This paper proves the complexity upper bounds and
states the conditions under which it applies.

LogootSplit~\cite{andre2013supporting} is a CRDT for sequences that allocates an
identifier to each string; splitting strings if need be. Therefore, it allocates
less identifiers. At worst, it allocates as many identifiers as Logoot, Treedoc
or \LSEQ. It constitutes an orthogonal improvement that applies to any of these
variable-size allocation functions. Hence, \LSEQ{}Split would exhibit the
improvements of both ``Split'' and \LSEQ.
