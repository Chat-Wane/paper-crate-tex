\begin{abstract}
  Distributed real-time editors such as Google Docs, or Etherpad allow users
  distributed in space and organizations to collaborate easily with only web
  browsers. Yet, main stream editors rely on central servers with issues in
  privacy, single point of failure and scalability.  Decentralized editors
  settle privacy problems but scalability issues remain.  None of existing
  algorithms provide satisfying complexities in both communication and space.
  In this paper, we propose \CRATE; a working decentralized real-time editor
  that supports large number of users working on large documents. In particular,
  \CRATE achieves a sublinearly upper-bounded communication complexity in
  $\mathcal{O}((\log d)^2\ln{m})$ where $d$ is the document size and $m$ the
  membership size. Thanks to WebRTC, \CRATE can be easily deployed on a network
  of browsers \TODO{i.e.} without servers.  We evaluate \CRATE on large-scale
  experiments in the Grid'5000 testbed involving uptill 600 participants. As
  expected, we observe a logarithmic progression of the generated traffic
  according to the size of the shared document and the number of participants.
