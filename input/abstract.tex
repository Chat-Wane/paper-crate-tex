  Distributed real-time editors such as Google Docs, or Etherpad allow people to
  work distributed in space and across organizations. However, main stream
  solutions rely on central servers with issues in privacy, censorship,
  single-point-of-failure, economic intelligence and scalability.

  Building a fully decentralized, scalable real-time editor requires to find a
  difficult compromise between time, space, and communication complexities with
  respect to the number of users and the size of shared documents.

  In this paper, we propose \CRATE; a real-time editor that runs on a network of
  browsers i.e. without servers. \CRATE relies on a new shared document
  structure in order to support large number of users working on large
  documents. Thanks to WebRTC, \CRATE can be easily deployed.

  We extensively describe each core component and provide the proof of the
  polylogarithmic upper-bound on the space complexity of the shared document. We
  evaluate \CRATE in large-scale experiments on the Grid'5000 testbed uptil 600
  participants. As expected, we observe a logarithmic progression of the
  generated traffic according to the size of the shared document and the number
  of participants.
