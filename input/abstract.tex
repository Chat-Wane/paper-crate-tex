  Distributed real-time editors made real-time editing easy for
  millions of users. However, main stream editors rely on Cloud
  services to mediate sessions raising privacy and scalability
  issues. Decentralized editors tackle privacy issues but scalability
  issues remains. We aim to build a decentralized editor that allows
  real-time editing anytime, anywhere, whatever is the number of
  participants. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a
  massively replicated sequence data structure that represents the shared
  document. We establish an original tradeoff on communication, time
  and space complexity to maintain this sequence over a network of
  browsers. We prove a sublinear upper bound on communication
  complexity while preserving an affordable time and space
  complexity. In order to validate this tradeoff, we built a full
  working editor and measured its performance on large scale
  experiments involving up till 600 participants. As expected, the
  results show a traffic increasing as $\mathcal{O}((\log I)^2\ln R)$ 
  where $I$ is the number of insertions in the document, and $R$ the 
  number of participants.
