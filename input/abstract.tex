\begin{abstract}
  Distributed real-time editors such as Google Docs, or Etherpad allow
  users distributed in space and organizations to collaborate easily
  with just web browsers. However, main stream editors rely on central
  servers with issues in privacy, single point of failure and
  scalability.  Decentralized editors can tackle privacy problems but
  scalability issues remain. 
% According to the different approaches,
%   decentralized editors deliver poor performances on CPU, space or
%   communications in presence of large number of users or large shared
%   documents. 
  Existing algorithms cannot garantee a sublinear communication
  complexity while preservering a bounded linear space complexity.  In
  this paper, we propose \CRATE; a working decentralized real-time
  editor that supports large number of users working on large
  documents. \CRATE achieves a communication complexity in $log(n)$
  where $n$ is the number of participants multiplied by an identifier
  in $log(s)^2$  where $s$ is the size of the document.
  Thanks to WebRTC, \CRATE can be easily deployed on a network of
  browsers i.e. without servers.

  We evaluate \CRATE in large-scale experiments on the Grid'5000
  testbed uptil 600 participants. As expected, we observe a
  logarithmic progression of the generated traffic according to the
  size of the shared document and the number of participants.

% If currently real-time editors is mainly used by small
%   groups, supporting large groups allow real-editing to be used in
%   large events such as massive online courses, conferences, TV-shows \ldots

  % Building a fully decentralized, scalable real-time editor requires
  % to find a difficult compromise between time, space, and
  % communication complexities.
