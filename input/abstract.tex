  The recent WebRTC technology has renewed the interest over large-scale
  distributed web applications. Over the last decades, the number of users of
  distributed collaborative editors like Google Docs, Etherpad, or CoWeb, has
  not ceased to increase. They allow distributing the work across space, time,
  and organizations to create better documents. However, current solutions
  either lack of scalablity or suffer of issues in privacy, censorship,
  single-point-of-failure, economic intelligence, restriction in terms of
  service. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing \CRATE, a
  distributed and decentralized collaborative editor running in web browsers.
  As core components, \CRATE uses \LSEQ to efficiently represent its shared
  document, and \SPRAY to automatically adjust the editing session membership.
  In this paper, we extensively describe each core components, we provide the
  proof of the polylarithmic upper-bound on the space complexity of the shared
  sequence. We evaluate \CRATE in large-scale experiments on the Grid'5000
  testbed. Being scalable and decentralized, it constitutes a serious competitor
  to current trending editors. 

  % The recent development distributed collaborative editors has renewed the
  % interest for efficient data structures that can allow a huge number of
  % simultaneous users. Indeed, existing editors lack scalability in terms of the
  % number of users, concurrency, and the size of the produced
  % documents. Additionally, centralised editors suffer from privacy issues,
  % single-point-of-failure, economic intelligence issues, and restrictions in
  % terms of service.  Several replicated data structures implementing sequences
  % have been proposed to alleviate most of the aforementioned issues. Yet, they
  % have an unsatisfying space complexity. Either they use tombstones and then
  % deleted elements are only hidden to the user or they allocate to each element
  % of the sequence an identifier that may be as large as the number of elements
  % in the sequence. This paper proposes an identifier allocation function named
  % \NAME{}. It provides identifiers enjoying a sub-linear space complexity
  % without being application specific and proves the polylogarithmic size of
  % these identifiers. Moreover, this paper provides all the outlines to develop
  % distributed collaborative editors that scale in all the aforementioned
  % dimensions. Using these outlines, we developed a prototype called
  % \EDITORNAME{} ({\sc c}ollabo{\sc rat}ive {\sc e}ditor) that we evaluated on
  % the Grid'5000 testbed. The results show that such editors, being
  % decentralised and scalable, could constitute a serious competitor to current
  % trending editors. In particular, it allows massive collaborative authoring of
  % huge documents which opens the field to new kinds of distributed
  % applications.
